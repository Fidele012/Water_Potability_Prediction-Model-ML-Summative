# 🌊 Water Potability Prediction - AI-Powered Water Safety Assessment

## 🎯 Mission & Problem Statement

"Millions in Africa lack safe water access, with only 56% of households having basic services, exposing them to waterborne diseases due to unreliable visual inspection methods. To solve this, we are developing an AI-powered system for real-time water quality monitoring and treatment guidance, aiming to eliminate outbreaks and ensure universal clean water access."

## Extended Description
**Access to safe water is a fundamental human right, yet only 56% of African households have basic drinking water services (DHS 2019/20), leaving millions vulnerable to waterborne diseases like cholera, dysentery, and COVID-19 from undetected contamination.** Traditional water quality testing requires expensive laboratory equipment and significant time delays that prevent real-time safety assessment, creating critical gaps in public health protection. **Our mission is to eliminate waterborne disease outbreaks by leveraging artificial intelligence to revolutionize water safety monitoring—developing an AI-powered predictive model that accurately assesses water potability through critical parameter analysis and provides real-time, actionable insights with personalized treatment recommendations.** By combining cutting-edge machine learning technology with community empowerment, we strive to ensure 100% access to clean drinking water, protecting health and fostering sustainable development across the continent.
